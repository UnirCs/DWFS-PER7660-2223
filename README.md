PER7660-2223
================

We will be using this repository for our collaborative work through the course.

Follow these instructions to work with it:

* Fork the main repository into your own account (this will generate a new repository in your GitHub account, since you are doing a fork). You have to do this only for the first time. 
* If you had already forked the repository some time ago, you need to sync your repository to the latest version that is now available. This is done by [configuring the remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork) and [syncing your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork). In short, you need to:
 * Establish remote: 
 
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/UnirDwfs/DWFS-PER7660-2223

 * Fetch any changes to it: 
 
        git fetch upstream
 
 * Checkout the local master branch of your fork: 
 
        git checkout master
 
 * Merge changes from the remote into your master branch: 
 
        git merge upstream/master

* Make any changes to your repository, according to the specific exercise
* Commit your changes into your local repository
* Push your changes to your online repository
* Make a pull request, so that I can check your changes and accept them into the master branch if everything is OK and there's no conflicts.
